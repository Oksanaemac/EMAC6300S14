THESIS STATEMENT should an argument, can be a road map to the paper itself that has to be followed.  Appears in the 
introduction,not too detailed.  More details come in subsequent paragraphs.  

ORGANIZATION can be two types: global (road map) or paragraph.  Paragraph has one topic that is signaled through a 
topic sentence.  Evidence.  Transitions in between the paragraphs.  Transitioning is switching topics.   Outline
the relationship between those topics: adding, contrasting, going deeper.  Use transition words: additonally, moreover,
on the other hand.   But do not give too many examples.  Build an argument, pay special attention to evidence, 
don't go into too much detail.  Reverse outline is very helpful in figuring out what has been actually written.  
Then gives a very good snapshot of how the argument is forming.   

USE OF SOURCES 
"Croutons" are bad in papers, interrupt the texture and flow, something realy jarring.  The quotes stylistically differ 
greately from the original writing.   Most of the time, you want to paraphraze.  Use quotes to avoid plagirizing.   But 
say "according to"... or "author writes", gives context and explanation to why the quote is included.  
Use introductory clause.. Don't let the quote the job for you or let the reader figure out why the quote is used.  
Use the quote to support your ideas.  Contextualize, analyse.
